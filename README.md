# Arbitration Session Scheduler
## Project Overview
A React-based web application for scheduling and managing arbitration sessions with features like custom calendar views, session booking, and conflict prevention.
Features


Custom calendar view with monthly perspective
Session scheduling with conflict detection
Create, update, and cancel arbitration sessions
Responsive design
Client-side routing

## Prerequisites

Node.js (v14+)
npm or yarn

## Setup Instructions

- Clone the repository
- Install dependencies:
```bash
  npm install
```

Start development server:
```bash
  npm start
```


## Technologies Used

- React
- React Router
- Tailwind CSS
- Lucide React Icons

## Additional Notes

Uses React Context for state management
Custom calendar component without external libraries
Implements basic conflict detection for session scheduling

## Future Improvements

- Backend integration
- User authentication
- More robust conflict resolution
- Enhanced error handling


# System Design Overview
The system is designed to manage arbitration sessions efficiently. It allows users (arbitrators and clients) to schedule, manage, and view sessions through a web application built with Next.js. Below are the key components and assumptions made during the design process.
Key Components

## User Roles:
Arbitrator: Can schedule sessions, manage existing sessions, and view their calendar.
User: Can view the calendar and book sessions.
Session Management:
Sessions are represented by a Session interface, which includes details like case number, date, time, duration, arbitrator, claimant, and respondent.
Sessions are stored in local storage for persistence across sessions.

## Context Providers:
SchedulerContext: Manages session data and provides functions to add, update, and delete sessions.
RoleContext: Manages user roles and provides functionality to switch between roles.
SelectedDateContext: Manages the currently selected date for viewing sessions.
## Calendar Views:
The application supports multiple calendar views (day, week, month) to display sessions.
Each view allows users to interact with the calendar and select dates to view or schedule sessions.
## UI Components:
Components are designed for reusability and modularity, including a calendar component, session forms, and navigation elements.
The UI is responsive, adapting to different screen sizes.
## Styling:
The application uses Tailwind CSS for styling, allowing for a utility-first approach to design.
Assumptions Made
Data Persistence:
Sessions are stored in local storage, assuming that users will access the application from the same device. This may not be suitable for multi-device access.
## User Authentication:
The current design does not include user authentication. It assumes that users will switch roles manually, which may not be secure in a production environment.
## Time Management:
The system assumes that all time inputs are in the same timezone. There is no handling for timezone differences, which could lead to scheduling conflicts.
## Session Overlap:
The system checks for overlapping sessions based on the arbitrator's schedule. It assumes that users will not attempt to book overlapping sessions.
## Error Handling:
Basic error handling is implemented (e.g., checking for valid date/time inputs), but more comprehensive error handling may be needed for a production environment.
## Scalability:
The current design is suitable for small to medium-sized applications. For larger applications, a more robust backend (e.g., a database) would be necessary to handle data persistence and user management.
## Conclusion
The system is designed to provide a user-friendly interface for managing arbitration sessions while ensuring that the core functionalities are met. However, there are several areas for improvement, particularly in user authentication, data persistence, and error handling, which should be addressed in future iterations.
